This is a mini HTML5/ Javascript game

Hey all!

This is a game I have been developing. 

Kinda like a few games out there but I wanted to make one in my style. 

Controls so far:

Left arrow key: Moves player left,

Right arrow key: Moves player right,

Space Bar: Fires

Left touch button: Moves player left,

Right touch button: Moves player right,

Tap screen: Fire

Main Javascript file... is pretty messy so far. I am currently trying to redo my old collision detection. 
You can view the old method by using with 0.1.3 index and javascript files. 

The CSS is not really backed up by version. 


Graphics are created by Christian Matsoukis and can only be used in this application.
